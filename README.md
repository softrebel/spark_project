# Spark ML Project
## A sample spark project written in python (with pyspark).

In this project, we use pyspark to load data and build  classification models step by step.

## Documentation
To access documents in persian language see [this link](./doc) 

## Requirements
- For better performance use python 3.8 or longer (python 3.11 not supported by pyspark when this document wrote).
- install dependencies:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
